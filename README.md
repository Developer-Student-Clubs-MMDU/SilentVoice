# SilentVoice

### Brief about the Idea - SilentVoice
  Our program addresses the communication gap faced by over 70 million sign language users by providing real-time 
translation of sign language into text and audio. It employs computer vision and machine learning to recognize gestures and convert them to text,
which is then transformed into speech using TTS technology. Additionally, it integrates conversational AI to facilitate real-time, one-on-one discussions, 
allowing users to input in sign language and receive voice responses. This solution enhances communication, promotes inclusivity, and enables natural,
fluid conversations between sign language users and non-users.

### Opportunities
How is it different from other solutions?<br/>
 Our application offers several unique features designed to enhance communication and inclusivity:<br/>

 Real-Time Bidirectional Translation:
Instantly converts sign language to text and text to audio, enabling seamless and interactive communication.    

 Conversational AI:
Supports dynamic, real-time interactions with AI-driven responses, making conversations more natural and engaging.

 Phone Call Integration (Future Feature):
Plans to integrate sign language translation into phone calls, a feature not commonly found in other solutions.
These features collectively address significant communication challenges, offering innovative solutions for Deaf individuals and those who do not know sign language.
